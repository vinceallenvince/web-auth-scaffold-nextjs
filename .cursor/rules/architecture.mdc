# Architecture and Component Organization

- All application code should be organized in /src/app

## Shared vs. Route-Specific
- Shared, reusable components live in `/src/components`
- Route-specific components live in their respective route folders (e.g., `/src/app/profile/components`)

## Directory Structure
- UI components are grouped by functional category in `/src/components/ui/`
- Auth components are in `/src/components/auth/`
- Each component type has its own subdirectory (button, form, layout, etc.)

## Barrel Files
- Each component directory has an index.ts barrel file
- Barrel files re-export all components with JSDoc documentation
- Import from barrels instead of direct component files when possible

## Import Patterns
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix for shared components
- Use relative imports for route-specific components
- Consolidate duplicate imports from the same path
- With Next.js automatic JSX runtime, React import is not required
