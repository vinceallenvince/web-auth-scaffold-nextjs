# Portability

## Avoid provider-specific features
- Donâ€™t use platform-only APIs, edge runtime hacks, or logging/analytics tools tied to a single host
- Stick with standard Next.js features like API routes and Server Actions

## Use environment variables, not hardcoded secrets
- All configuration (e.g., DB URLs, auth secrets) should come from .env.local
- Load them via process.env in code, and document required values in .env.example

## Database should be externally hosted (e.g., Neon, PlanetScale, Supabase)
- This avoids tying DB access to the host environment

## Authentication, email services, and APIs should work in local dev and in the cloud
- For example, sending magic links via SendGrid or Resend should work regardless of hosting platform

## Testing and dev tools should not rely on a specific platform's CI/CD
- Use Vitest, Playwright, and ESLint locally and in any CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Replit Deploy Hooks)
