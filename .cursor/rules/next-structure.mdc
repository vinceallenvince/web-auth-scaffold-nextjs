# Next.js Application Structure

## I18n Structure
- The app uses App Router with a `[lang]` segment at the root level
- All routes should be inside the `src/app/[lang]/` directory
- The root layout at `src/app/layout.tsx` sets the HTML lang attribute
- The locale segment layout is in `src/app/[lang]/layout.tsx`
- Supported locales are defined in `src/constants/i18n.ts`

## Navigation
- Use the Next.js Link component with locale-prefixed hrefs
- Navigation links should maintain the current locale
- Use relative paths within the same locale segment

## Dictionaries
- Translation files are located in `src/app/[lang]/dictionaries/`
- Dictionary loader is kept server-side only (never imported in client components)
- Language switcher preserves the current path when changing locales

## Static Generation
- Routes are pre-rendered for all supported locales
- The `generateStaticParams` function in layouts defines which locales to pre-render
