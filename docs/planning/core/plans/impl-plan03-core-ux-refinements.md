# Implementation Plan: Core UX Refinements

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the approach for refining the core UX for our Next.js authentication scaffold, including implementing a hero component for the home and login pages, a footer for all pages, toast notifications and nav bar enhancements.

## Context

Based on the UI/UX specifications in [core specs](/docs/specs/product/core-specs.md) , we need to implement the following using Daisy UI components:

1. A hero component on the home page welcoming visitors and prompting login
2. A hero component with form explaining login via magic link
3. A footer component for all pages with links to About and Contact pages
4. Toast notifications for all magic link login interactions
5. Nav bar enhancements to include theme switcher, login/logout link and Profile link

This implementation will futher refine the user experience across the application.
