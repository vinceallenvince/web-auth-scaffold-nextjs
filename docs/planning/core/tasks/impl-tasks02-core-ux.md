# Implementation Tasks: Core UX

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation tasks for building the core UX components for our Next.js authentication scaffold. These tasks follow the implementation plan and are organized by phase.

## Phase 1: Design System Foundation

### UX-01: Configure Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
**Type**: Task  
**Summary**: Set up and configure Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for theming and component styling
**Description**:
- Configure Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI to establish the foundation for our design system
- Set up theme colors, design tokens, and utility classes that will be used throughout the application

**Implementation Details**:
- Follow these steps:
  1. **Add required dependencies**:
     - Install DaisyUI and required Tailwind plugins

  2. **Configure Tailwind**:
     - Update `tailwind.config.js` to include DaisyUI and set up themes
     - Configure content paths, theme extensions, and plugin settings
     - Set up DaisyUI custom themes, bumblebee for light and Night for dark ([DaisyUI themes](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/))

  3. **Set up global CSS variables**:
     - Update `src/styles/globals.css` to include custom CSS variables for theming
     - Add base styles for the application

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [X] Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI are properly installed and configured
- [X] Theme colors and design tokens are defined in the Tailwind config
- [X] Basic utility classes are available for use in components
- [X] DaisyUI themes (light and dark) are properly configured
- [X] Global CSS variables are set up for custom theming needs

**Common Pitfalls & Tips**:
- Ensure content paths in Tailwind config correctly match your project structure
- DaisyUI's default themes may need customization to match your brand colors
- Remember to include the Tailwind directives in your global CSS file
- Check for any conflicts between your custom theme extensions and DaisyUI defaults

**Testing Instructions**:
- Create a simple test component using Tailwind classes and DaisyUI components
- Verify styles are applied correctly
- Check that theme colors render as expected

**Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours
**Story Points**: 2
**Dependencies**: None  
**Status**: DONE

### UX-02: Implement Theme Provider and Light/Dark Mode Toggle
**Type**: Task  
**Summary**: Create a theme provider with context API for light/dark mode switching
**Description**:
- Implement a theme provider that manages light/dark mode preferences
- Create a theme toggle component for users to switch between modes
- Implement system preference detection and persistence via localStorage

**Implementation Details**:
- Follow these steps:
  1. **Create a theme context and provider**:
     - Create a new file `src/app/providers/theme-provider.tsx`
     - Implement theme context with React context API
     - Define types for theme and provider props
     - Create context provider component with state management

  2. **Create localStorage hook**:
     - Create a utility hook for localStorage persistence
     - Handle browser compatibility and SSR scenarios

  3. **Create theme toggle component**:
     - Create a theme toggle button component
     - Implement theme switching functionality
     - Add visual indicators for current theme

  4. **Update root layout**:
     - Add the ThemeProvider to the root layout
     - Configure default theme preference

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [X] Theme provider is implemented with context API
- [X] Light/dark mode toggle component works correctly
- [X] System preference detection is implemented
- [X] Theme preference is persisted in localStorage
- [X] Theme changes are applied immediately without page refresh
- [X] Default theme is set to system preference

**Common Pitfalls & Tips**:
- Ensure theme changes apply to the entire application without flashing
- Remember to handle SSR scenarios to prevent hydration mismatches
- Test with system preference changes to ensure detection works
- Handle localStorage unavailability (e.g., in private browsing mode)

**Testing Instructions**:
- Click the theme toggle button and verify theme changes
- Refresh the page and verify theme preference is maintained
- Change system theme preference and verify detection works
- Test in incognito/private browsing to ensure graceful degradation

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours
**Story Points**: 3
**Dependencies**: UX-01  
**Status**: DONE

### UX-03: Create Layout Components
**Type**: Task  
**Summary**: Implement responsive layout components for page structure
**Description**:
- Create reusable layout components that provide consistent structure and responsive behavior
- Implement container, grid, and section components with appropriate spacing

**Implementation Details**:
- Follow these steps:
  1. **Create container component**:
     - Create a new file `src/app/components/ui/layout/container.tsx`
     - Implement responsive container with appropriate padding
     - Support custom class names and props

  2. **Create grid components**:
     - Create grid layout components with responsive columns
     - Implement responsive gap spacing
     - Support different column configurations

  3. **Create section components**:
     - Create section components for page structure
     - Implement consistent vertical spacing
     - Support custom styling

  4. **Create spacing utilities**:
     - Define responsive spacing scale in the application

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [X] Container component with responsive padding is implemented
- [X] Grid system with responsive columns is created
- [X] Section components with proper spacing are implemented
- [X] All components adapt correctly to different viewport sizes
- [X] Layout components ensure consistent spacing throughout the app

**Common Pitfalls & Tips**:
- Test layouts on various screen sizes to ensure proper responsiveness
- Be careful with nested container components as they may cause unexpected padding
- Use Tailwind's responsive prefix system for different viewport sizes
- Keep layout components simple and focused on structure, not presentation

**Testing Instructions**:
- Create a test page with various layout components
- Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Verify that spacing and structure are consistent across breakpoints

     - Implement utilities for responsive typography adjustments

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Typography scale is defined with appropriate sizes
- [ ] Heading components (H1-H6) are implemented with responsive sizes
- [ ] Text components for paragraphs and other elements are created
