# Application Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the application after the migration to a feature-based structure.

## Overview

The application follows a feature-based architecture that separates core functionality (boilerplate, reusable components, etc.) from feature-specific code. This separation makes the codebase more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.

## Core Module

The core module contains all shared functionality that is used across multiple features. It includes:

- **UI Components**: Basic UI components from shadcn/ui
- **Layout Components**: Navbar, Footer, and the CoreLayout
- **Authentication**: Auth hooks, components, and providers
- **Routing**: Centralized route definitions
- **Providers**: Context providers for global state
- **Internationalization**: i18n setup and translations

## Feature Modules

Each feature module contains all the code related to a specific feature. This includes:

- **Components**: Feature-specific UI components
- **Pages**: Page components for the feature
- **Hooks**: Feature-specific hooks
- **API**: Server-side API endpoints for the feature

Features are self-contained and only depend on the core module, not on other features. This ensures separation of concerns and prevents circular dependencies.

## Routing

Routes are defined in `client/src/core/routes.tsx` and organized by category:

- **Core Routes**: Authentication-related routes
- **Feature Routes**: Feature-specific routes
- **Main Routes**: Main application routes

Each feature can define its own routes, which are then imported and used in the central routes file.

## Server Architecture

The server follows a similar architecture, with core functionality separated from feature-specific code:

- **Core**: Authentication, database setup, logging, middleware
- **Features**: Feature-specific API endpoints
- **Middleware**: Centralized middleware for request/response handling

API endpoints follow a RESTful structure, organized by feature:

- `/api/profile/` - Profile feature endpoints
- `/api/admin/` - Admin feature endpoints
- `/api/info/` - Info feature endpoints

## Adding New Features

To add a new feature:

1. Create a new directory under `client/src/features/`
2. Add components, pages, and hooks specific to the feature
3. Add routes for the feature in `client/src/core/routes.tsx`
4. Create API endpoints under `server/features/` if needed
5. Register API routes in `server/core/routes.ts`

## Best Practices

- Keep features independent from each other
- Use the core module for shared functionality
- Keep related code together in the same feature directory
- Follow the established pattern for naming and organization
- Document feature-specific code with README files
- Use proper error handling and logging

## Migration Status

The migration from the old architecture to the new feature-based architecture is completed. All functionality now follows the new structure, and the application has been tested to ensure it works as expected.
