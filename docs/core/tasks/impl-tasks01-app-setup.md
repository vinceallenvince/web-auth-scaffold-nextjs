# Implementation Tasks: App Setup

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation tasks for setting up the Next.js authentication scaffold with App Router and Supabase integration. Each task corresponds to steps in the implementation plan and is broken down into manageable chunks of work.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

### SETUP-01: Project Scaffolding
**Type**: Task  
**Summary**: Create and initialize the Next.js project with required configuration  
**Description**:
- Set up the initial Next.js project with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

**Implementation Details**:
- Follow these steps:
  1. **Create the Next.js project**:
     - Run `pnpm create next-app web-auth-scaffold-nextjs`
     - If you face issues with company npm registry:
       ```bash
       pnpm create next-app web-auth-scaffold-nextjs --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
       ```
     - Select TypeScript when prompted
     - Select ESLint when prompted
     - Select Tailwind CSS when prompted
     - Select App Router when prompted

  2. **Verify project structure**:
     - Ensure `app` directory is created
     - Confirm TypeScript configuration exists
     - Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured

  3. **Configure VSCode**:
     - Set up `.vscode/settings.json` with appropriate TypeScript and ESLint settings
     - Add recommended extensions to `.vscode/extensions.json`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [X] Project is created with Next.js 13+ App Router
- [X] TypeScript is properly configured
- [X] Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- [X] ESLint is set up correctly
- [X] VSCode settings are optimized for development

**Common Pitfalls & Tips**:
- Make sure to select "App Router (recommended)" and not "Pages Router" during setup
- The project name should match the directory name to avoid confusion
- If using company VPN, you might encounter npm registry issues
- Check that Node.js version is v18+ before starting

**Testing Instructions**:
- Run `pnpm dev` and verify the app loads at http://localhost:3000
- Make a simple change to app/page.tsx and confirm hot reload works
- Check that Tailwind styles are applied correctly by adding a Tailwind class

**Relevant User Story**:
- As a developer, I should be able to run this application locally with full database functionality

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours  
**Story Points**: 2  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Status**: DONE

### SETUP-02: Dependency Installation
**Type**: Task  
**Summary**: Install all required dependencies for the project  
**Description**:
- Install core dependencies, development tools, and UI libraries needed for the application

**Implementation Details**:
- Follow these steps:
  1. **Install authentication and database dependencies**:
     - Run `pnpm add @auth/core @auth/prisma-adapter @prisma/client zod`
     - If you face issues with company npm registry:
       ```bash
       pnpm add @auth/core @auth/prisma-adapter @prisma/client zod --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
       ```
     - Verify packages are correctly added to package.json

  2. **Install development and testing dependencies**:
     - Run `pnpm add -D prisma vitest @vitejs/plugin-react @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom playwright @playwright/test`
     - If you face issues with company npm registry:
       ```bash
       pnpm add -D prisma vitest @vitejs/plugin-react @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom playwright @playwright/test --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
       ```
     - Verify packages are correctly added to package.json

  3. **Install UI dependencies**:
     - Run `pnpm add daisyui @tailwindcss/forms`
     - If you face issues with company npm registry:
       ```bash
       pnpm add daisyui @tailwindcss/forms --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
       ```
     - Configure Tailwind CSS to use DaisyUI in `tailwind.config.js`
     
  4. **Configure Registry**:
     - Note: A local `.npmrc` file is included that configures npm to use the public registry for this project
     - Verify the `.npmrc` file contains: `registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [X] All core dependencies are installed successfully
- [X] Development and testing dependencies are installed
- [X] UI dependencies (DaisyUI, Tailwind Forms) are installed
- [X] Tailwind CSS is configured to use DaisyUI in config file
- [X] Registry is properly configured to avoid company npm issues

**Common Pitfalls & Tips**:
- Always verify package versions in package.json after installation
- Some dependencies may have peer dependencies that need to be installed separately
- Make sure your Node.js version is compatible with installed packages
- If packages fail to install, try clearing the pnpm cache with `pnpm store prune`
- DaisyUI needs specific configuration in tailwind.config.js to work properly

**Testing Instructions**:
- Check package.json to verify all dependencies are listed with correct versions
- Run `pnpm install` to ensure dependencies resolve without conflicts
- Check tailwind.config.js to verify DaisyUI is in the plugins array
- Try importing a component from one of the packages in a test file to verify it's available

**Dependencies**: SETUP-01  
**Status**: DONE

### SETUP-03: Environment Configuration
**Type**: Task  
**Summary**: Set up environment variables and configuration files  
**Description**:
- Create necessary environment configuration for development and production environments

**Implementation Details**:
- Follow these steps:
  1. **Create environment variable templates**:
     - Create `.env.example` with required variables:
       - `DATABASE_URL`
       - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
       - `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
       - `EMAIL_FROM`
       - `NEXTAUTH_URL`
     - Add documentation comments for each variable

  2. **Set up local development environment**:
     - Create `.env.local` based on `.env.example`
     - Generate secure values for secrets
     - Configure `.gitignore` to exclude `.env.local`

  3. **Configure Next.js for environment**:
     - Update `next.config.js` as needed for environment configuration
     - Add validation for required environment variables on startup

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [X] `.env.example` file created with all required variables and documentation
- [X] `.env.local` file created with valid values for local development
- [X] `.gitignore` configured to exclude `.env.local` and other sensitive files
- [X] `next.config.js` updated with any necessary environment configuration
- [X] Environment validation added to prevent app startup with missing variables

**Common Pitfalls & Tips**:
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control as it contains sensitive information
- Use a strong random value for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (e.g., generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your local development URL (usually http://localhost:3000)
- Database URL format should follow Prisma's connection string format for PostgreSQL

**Testing Instructions**:
- Verify that the app starts correctly with all environment variables set
- Test that the app correctly fails to start when a required variable is missing
- Check that sensitive variables are not exposed in client-side code
- Ensure environment variables are accessible in both server and client components as appropriate

       ```
     - Verify the app loads at http://localhost:3000
     - Test that hot reloading works correctly
     - Ensure TypeScript compilation is functioning

  2. **Create database connectivity test**:
     - Create `app/api/verify-db/route.ts` for database connection testing
     - Implement Prisma connection verification
     - Test endpoint by accessing `/api/verify-db`

  3. **Document verification outcomes**:
     - Create a verification checklist document
     - Note any issues encountered and their resolutions
     - Add troubleshooting guidance for common problems

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [X] Next.js development server starts without errors
- [X] Hot module reloading works when making changes to files
- [X] TypeScript compiles code without errors
- [X] Database connectivity test endpoint returns success
- [X] Verification checklist document created

**Common Pitfalls & Tips**:
- Make sure to use the correct Node.js version (v18+) for compatibility
- If hot reloading isn't working, check that you haven't disabled it in Next.js config
- The database connection may fail if your IP isn't authorized in Supabase settings
- Keep the verification route secured or remove it before production deployment
- Use Prisma Studio (`npx prisma studio`) for visual database inspection during verification

**Testing Instructions**:
- Run `pnpm dev` and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to verify the app loads
- Make a small change to a visible component and verify it updates without full reload
- Visit the database verification endpoint and confirm successful connection
- Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` to verify there are no TypeScript errors in the codebase
