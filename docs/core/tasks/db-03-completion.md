# DB-03: Database Schema Deployment - Completion Report

## Task Summary
The task "DB-03: Database Schema Deployment" involved deploying the database schema to Supabase and creating seed data for development and testing.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Schema Deployment
- The Prisma schema was successfully pushed to the Supabase database using:
  ```bash
  npx prisma db push
  ```
- The database tables were created with the correct structure including:
  - User table
  - Account table
  - Session table
  - VerificationToken table
  - Proper relations between tables
  - Necessary indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Seed Data Creation
- Created a comprehensive seed script at `prisma/seed.ts` that:
  - Implements test user accounts (admin and demo user)
  - Creates mock session data
  - Sets up test OAuth accounts
  - Adds verification tokens for testing email verification flows
  - Includes detailed console output for seeding progress

- Added script configuration to `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "db:seed": "npx prisma db seed"
  },
  "prisma": {
    "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts"
  }
  ```

### 3. Documentation
- Created a detailed `SEED_DATA.md` file documenting:
  - Available test users and credentials
  - Test data information (sessions, OAuth accounts, tokens)
  - Instructions for using the seed data in testing
  - Guidance on resetting seed data
  - Production considerations

## Testing Verification
The seed script was successfully executed with `npx prisma db seed` and all test data was properly created in the database.

## Key Benefits
- Development team can now easily set up consistent test data
- Multiple authentication scenarios can be tested using the seed data
- OAuth flows can be verified with mock account connections
- Email verification flow can be tested with pre-created tokens
- The seed script includes safety features to prevent accidental data loss in production

## Next Steps
This completes the DB-03 task. The team can now proceed to:
- AUTH-01: Authentication Setup
- TEST-01: Test Directory Structure

## Dependencies Resolved
This task satisfies the requirements for:
- DB-02 (Prisma Schema Configuration) by successfully deploying the schema
- Prepares for AUTH-01 by creating test authentication data

## Notes
- The seed script is designed to be idempotent, allowing it to be run multiple times without error
- It automatically clears existing data in development environments before seeding
- Production safety checks are included to prevent accidental data loss
