# Logging Specification

This document outlines the logging practices and configurations for the Web Authentication Scaffold application.

## Overview

The application uses Winston for structured logging, providing a comprehensive logging system that captures various levels of log messages and outputs them to multiple destinations.

## Log Levels

- **error**: Critical errors that require immediate attention
- **warn**: Warning conditions that should be reviewed
- **info**: Informational messages about normal operation
- **debug**: Detailed debugging information (only in development)

## Log Outputs

Logs are written to multiple destinations:

- **Console**: All logs in development, info and above in production
- **error.log**: Error-level logs only
- **combined.log**: All logs
- **exceptions.log**: Uncaught exceptions
- **rejections.log**: Unhandled promise rejections

## Log Format

Logs are stored in JSON format with the following fields:

- **timestamp**: When the log was created
- **level**: Log level (error, warn, info, debug)
- **message**: Main log message
- **service**: Service name (web-auth-scaffold)
- **Additional context**: Each log includes relevant context data

## Configuration

- **Log Directory**: Logs are stored in the `logs` directory, created if it doesn't exist
- **Environment-based Level**: Log level is set to 'info' in production and 'debug' in development
- **Console Logging**: Enabled in non-production environments with colorized output for readability

## Integration

- **Morgan Integration**: A stream object is available for potential integration with Morgan for HTTP request logging

## Best Practices

- Ensure sensitive information is not logged
- Regularly monitor log files for errors and warnings
- Rotate log files to manage disk space

This specification ensures consistent and effective logging practices across the application, aiding in monitoring, debugging, and maintaining the system.
