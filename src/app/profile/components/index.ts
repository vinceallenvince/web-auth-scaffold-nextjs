/**
 * Profile Route Component Exports
 * 
 * This file exports components specific to the profile route.
 * Following the Next.js App Router conventions, route-specific components
 * are located within their respective route folders rather than in the
 * shared components directory.
 * 
 * Organization Strategy:
 * - Components are scoped to this specific route
 * - They handle profile-specific UI and functionality
 * - The exports are grouped here to provide a clean import experience
 *   within the profile route pages
